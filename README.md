# GDParser
## âš In active developement
Some thing can change but not that much.

This is a simple Godot GDScript v2 parser.
For it is only parsing var, func, signal and class attributes.
This project is mainly to simplify C# -> GDScript interoperability.

#### Get it here -> https://www.nuget.org/packages/GDParser/

## Feature
- [X] Parse Class structure(Class_name, extend, var, func, signal).
- [ ] Parse Enum.
- [ ] Parse code(Will not be supported for now).
And more to come.

### How to use
```csharp
using GDParser;

var source = "GDScript source code";
var gdClass = Parser.Parse()

var className = gdClass.Name;
var variables = gdClass.Variables;
```
